<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>This website started out as a small, ambitious idea by <a href="https://www.github.com/qdang16">Quinton Dang</a> and hopes to find traction in the future. Here's to helping build resources for our communities!</p><br><br><br>
<p>
  The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
  is a project to make a book and screencasts to teach web development
  with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This
  is the sample application for the tutorial.
